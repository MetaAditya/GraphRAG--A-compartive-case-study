      " ANSWER: The policies from the British Empire economy led to a decline in India's share of the world economy and industrial output, resulting in a weakened economic structure by the time of independence in 1947. This legacy included extensive public ownership, regulation, and trade barriers, which characterized India's economic model. The reliance on bureaucrat-driven enterprises and the Licence Raj contributed to inefficiencies. By 1991, these factors, combined with an acute balance of payments crisis and excessive reliance on imports, culminated in a significant economic crisis, highlighting the vulnerabilities inherited from the colonial economic structure.\n"

      " ANSWER: British colonial economic policies led to the decline of India's share in the world economy and industrial output. This decline created a reliance on imports and external factors, which worsened India's economic problems starting in 1985. The resulting twin deficit, along with a huge fiscal deficit, set the stage for the 1991 economic crisis, exacerbated by the fall of the Eastern Bloc and the collapse of trade relations with the Soviet Union, India's largest trading partner until 1991.\n"
